In the next lecture, we'll install Docker on a virtual EC2 instance.

Please note that the following command (which is used in the next lecture) will unfortunately not work anymore:

amazon-linux-extras install docker
Instead, use this approach / these commands:

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum -y install docker
 
sudo service docker start
 
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
Make sure to log out + back in after running these commands.

Once you logged back in, run this command:

sudo systemctl enable docker
Thereafter, you can check whether Docker is available by running:

docker version
